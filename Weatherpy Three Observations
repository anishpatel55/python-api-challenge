1. When comparing max temperature with city latitude, it is clear that the cities near the 0 degree latitude have the highest max temperature. The r-squared is high showing that there is correlation when plotting max temperature with city latitude.
2. There is no correlation when looking at wind speed versus the city latitude. Majority of the cities wind speed is under 15 mph.
3. I was expecting cloudiness to be more correlated versus latitude but the r-squared shows that there is no real relationship between the two at 0.30 for the northern hemisphere and 0.24 for the southern hemisphere
